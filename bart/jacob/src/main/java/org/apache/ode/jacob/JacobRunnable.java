/**
 * Base class for process abstractions. An abstraction is a parameterized
 * process template, whose instantiation is termed a <em>concretion</em>.
 * Abstractions may define a set of bound channel names or other parameters
 * which are resolved at the time of the concretion. For example the process
 * term abstraction of a memory cell:
 * <code>Cell(s,v) := s ? { read(...) = ... & write(...) = ... }</code> would
 * be represented by the following Java class: <code>
 * <pre>
 * public class Cell extends JacobRunnable {
 *     private CellChannel s;
 * 
 *     private Object v;
 * 
 *     public Cell(CellChannel s, Object v) {
 *         this.s = s;
 *         this.v = v;
 *     }
 * 
 *     public void run() {
 *      object(new CellChannelListener(s) { read(...) {...}
 *                             write(...) {...} } );
 *    }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </code> An example of the Java expression representing the concretion of this
 * abstraction would look like: <code>
 * <pre>
 *    .
 *    .
 *    // (new c) Cell(c,v)
 *    Integer v = Integer.valueOf(0);
 *    CellChannel c = (CellChannel)newChannel(CellChannel.class);
 *    instance(new Cell(c, v));
 *    .
 *    .
 * </pre>
 * </code>
