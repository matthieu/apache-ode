  <body>
    <p>Data-Access Object (DAO) interfaces used by the BPEL Service Provider 
    to communicate with the data store; can be used to customize the 
    BPEL persistence layer.
    The BPEL DAO layer is used to maintain persistent state of each
    active BPEL process instance. This includes the values of scope
    variables, as well as instance &quot;state snapshots&quot; that
    may need to be persisted due to the activation of receive, pick,
    or invoke activity that cannot be immediately satisfied.  Like
    the DAO of the framework (see {@link com.fs.jlo.sfwk.bapi.dao}), the
    BPEL DAO is a &quot;dumb&quot; object-relational model supporting
    transactional access.</p>
