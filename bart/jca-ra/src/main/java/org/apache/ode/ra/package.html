    <p>The client connection interface (&quot;CCI&quot;) provides a
    uniform mechanism for accessing services hosted inside the ODE
    container from objects outside the container. For example,
    through the CCI a client can connect to a running BPEL service
    to inspect the state of a process instance; similarly, a Servlet
    may use the CCI to notify a ODE SOAP service that a new message
    has arrived.</p>
    
    <p>The CCI supports marshalling of invocations for arbitrary
    interfaces that are defined by each particular service provider.
    Both blocking and non-blocking operations are supported.</p>
