  Apache ODE
==============

Apache ODE is a WS-BPEL compliant web services orchestration engine.
It organizes web services calls following a process description
written in BPEL. Another way to describe it would be a web service
capable workflow engine.

For more information check the following resources:

 * Our web site: http://incubator.apache.org/ode
 * The WS-BPEL 2.0 technical committee webinars linked here:
     http://incubator.apache.org/ode/introduction.html

Apache ODE is an open source project, as such we welcome all your
help and contributions. To participate and get involved, our mailing
lists are the best resources to start from:
    http://incubator.apache.org/ode/mailing-lists.html

Finally here is a non exhaustive but representative features list:

 * Compliant with both BPEL4WS 1.1 and WS-BPEL 2.0.
 * Deploys both as a WAR in any web container (using an Axis2-based
 communication layer) or as a JBI service assembly.
 * Small footprint server suitable for experimentation or 
 single-server production use.
 * Compiled approach to BPEL that provides detailed analysis and 
 validation at the command line or at deployment.
 * Processes hot deployment and management web service interface (war
 deployment only).
 * High level API to the engine that allows you to integrate the core
 with virtually any communication layer or even embed it.
