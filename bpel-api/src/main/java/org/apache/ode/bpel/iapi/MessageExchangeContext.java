     * (as it is called from within a transaction): to this end, actual invocation may be deferred or a synchronous operation may be
     * decomposed into two asynchronous "legs". The integration layer must provide a response to the message exchange via the

     * Invocation of reliable, unreliable, and transactional transports should be treated differently. A brief description of how

     * 
     * <p>
     * Reliable transports are transports such as JMS or WS-RM. For these transports, the request should be enrolled in the current
     * transaction. This necessarily implies that the request is deferred until the transaction is committed. It follows that for
     * reliable request-response invocations the response to the invocation will necessarily be processed in a separate transaction.
     * </p>
     * 
     * <p>
     * Unreliable transports are transports such as HTTP. For these transports, where the operation is not idempotent it is
     * typically required that "at most once" semantics are achieved. To this end the invocation could be noted and deferred until
     * after the transaction is committed.
     * </p>
     * 
     * <p>
     * Transactional transports are those transports that support transaction propagation. For these transports, the invocation can
     * be processed immediately and the response provided to the engine via the {@link PartnerRoleMessageExchange#reply(Message)}
     * method.
     * </p>
